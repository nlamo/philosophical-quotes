# philosophical-quotes

This is a small React application that uses the Material UI library. 

The goal of this application is to allow the user to retrieve philosophical quotes depending on the particular mood that they happen to be in.

Instead of retrieving a quote that correlates directly with that particular mood (e.g. 'Analytic' or 'Pessimistic'), a *contrasting* quote will be retrieved. The idea is to introduce cognitive flexibility. 

It is, of course, debatable whether our _moods_ could be described with terms such as 'Esoteric' or 'Analytic', as these are really more states of thinking. However, since our relationship with knowledge is inherently affective, I don't personally draw a sharp distinction between moods and states of mind. 

If you'd like more insight into this line of thinking, check out Spinoza.
